Comparison to national poverty lines may be useful for discussion related to one country or domestic policy but that can be calculated separately as needed.\\nAn organisation may choose to use the PPI score evaluation of the propensity of a farmer or community to be poor as another option that can be more relevant in some rural areas and can be calculated separately as needed.

Instead, \"children in school at the appropriate grade level\" serves to provide a valuable proxy that directly reflects an outcome of child labour and results in a better understanding of the plight of children in a community. Note that in many countries the compulsory school age may be lower than 18, and organisations are welcome to include other age limits in their own analysis of the data, but children in the appropriate grade for their age through 18 serves as an aspirational target.

At this initial stage of common metrics, it is necessary to note that capturing that requires either a labour assessment targeting workers (risky for them, often requires an independent surveyor, and timing is critical) or a risk assessment or data from the wider community (consider costs and comparability). This is an important topic and it is necessary to adequately understand which communities are more prone to this situation, therefore, we propose that it be addressed with different tools than these basic performance indicators developed with the GCP.",

Producers that answer '0 days' are considered to be food secure. Optimally, the approach would also include the months when food insecurity occurred in order to understand the times of year when producers experience more or less food security.\\nMore comprehensive nutritional indicators can be expensive and require significant technical ability, time and resources to carry out effectively, so instead the focus is on days of food insecurity as a proxy.
